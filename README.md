These two Python scripts were developed to analyse parcel delivery performance.
The first script compares arrival and sign-off times to identify shipments delivered more than four days after arrival.
The second script tracks dispatch times and detects shipments pending delivery for over 24 hours.
Both scripts automatically clean and convert date data, calculate time gaps, filter exceptions, and export the results to Excel for further analysis.
